# Turning in EV3

There are two types of turning in EV3:
1. Pivot turns - in this type, one of the wheels move while the other stays put as the pivot.
2. Spin turns  - in this type, both wheels move, but in opposite directions, making it ideal for sharp turns like a 180-degree turn.

The program `Pivot turn` shows how to perform a pivot turn using any two large montored bot like the `DroidBot Jr` which I used.
